Implement Stack using Queues

==

 Implement the following operations of a stack using queues.

   * push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
   * pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.
   * top() -- Get the top element.
   * empty() -- Return whether the stack is empty.
Notes:

   # You must use only standard operations of a queue -- which means only push to back, peek/pop from front, size, and is empty operations are valid.
