# Remove Nth Node From End of List
==
Given a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of list and return its head.

For example,
```
   Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

   After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
```
## 理解
前进n个，第二个指针再出发，直到第一个指针到NULL
